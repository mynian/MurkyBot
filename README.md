# MurkyBot

This is a bot written for Discord in Python to do a few things.

1. Automatically request the status of the world server for a warcraft realm and post to a channel when a change happens.

2. Allows users to manually request the current server status by typing +status

3. Some other commands that I add randomly to either test or mess with my discord members.

4. Use status indicator LEDs that I have mounted to a custom printed part on my raspberry pi case to indicate what the current status is at a glance from a distance. (Only really useful for how I have it placed)
